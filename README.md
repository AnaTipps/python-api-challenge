# python-api-challenge

**Background** Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, in this challenge I applied what you'd learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer some questions sucha as: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" or "what are the hoiday destinations ideal for me at different times in the year?". 
Graphs and extra notes cab be found in the posted jupyter notebooks.
